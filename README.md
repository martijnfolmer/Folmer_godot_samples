# Folmer_godot_samples
A collection of Sample scenes, scripts, that can be used in godot projects (mostly for my own education, but feel free
to use any of it if you wish)
It should be noted that there can be overlap between these samples and build in godot functionality. 
This is an ongoing project and will be updated regularly


## Easing
Common easing functions, created in gdscript in scripts/utils/class_easing, and their visualisations.
NOTE : There are build-in versions of these easing functions in godot, more information can be found here : https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_tween.html
